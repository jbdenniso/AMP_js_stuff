				PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY. <BR>
 <br>
				On each trial, you will see three images in quick succession. One will be the image of a face, the second will be a household item, and the third will be "static". The face serves as a warning for the second image. Your task will be to determine the value of the household item after being presented with an image after only a short amount of time.<BR> </br>
				<p> Your task will be to determine the value of the household item after being presented with an image after only a short amount of time.<br>

				
				<br>If you think the object is not at all valuable press the  "q" key. <br>
				If you think the object is a little valuable press the "e" key.<br>
If you think the object is very valuable  press the "i" key.<br>
If you think the object isextremely valuable press the "p" key.<br>
 </p>

			<p>
				It is important to note that the face image can sometimes bias
peopleâ€™s judgments of the household items. Because we are interested in how
people can avoid being biased,
<b>please try your absolute best not to
let the face images bias your judgment of the household items!</b>
Give
us an honest assessment of the household items, regardless of the images that
precede them.</p><p>You will complete a total of 20 trials.</p><p>When you are ready to start the experiment, please press 'Begin'.
